# AEGuide

## About

An AE2 fork with everything **but** the **guide book** removed.

The guide book and its Markdown documentation feature
always made me feel they are so nice that they deserve to be a separate component, just like Patchouli - 
in fact I feel it could easily be the next Patchouli if it can be its own lightweight mod. 

This is a rather personal project. This mod can't be installed together with AE2 right now 
as the packages have yet to be relocated.
